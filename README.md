# ERAV3_PP_S7_MNISTAWS
MNIST model training on AWS.
## Target:
99.4% (this must be consistently shown in your last few epochs, and not a one-time achievement)
Less than or equal to 15 Epochs
Less than 8000 Parameters
Do this using your modular code. Every model that you make must be there in the model.py file as Model_1, Model_2, etc.
Once done, train on SageMaker or EC2
